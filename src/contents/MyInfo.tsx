            Hi! I‚Äôm Thi, by profession, a full-stack software engineer. üë©üèª‚Äçüíª
        </Header>
        <p>
            Sometimes, I love creating software to solve problems and improve daily efficiency for myself and others. I'm also passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge.
            Recently, I discovered my love for building React.js, TypeScript applications, and I'm working on a couple projects involving these two technologies, as well as writing tutorials to share what I learn.
        </p>

        <p>
            At other times, I enjoy being active and spending time outdoors, reading, traveling, and exploring new places.
            Besides work, I think life offers so many meaningful and exciting experiences! Therefore, if this site appears to be outdated, please do not think of me as a slacker (although you could be right sometimes...)!
            Because I might be somewhere enjoying a beautiful hike or bike ride, running, doing yoga, playing volleyball, reading a good book, practicing guitar, volunteering, or spending quality time with my family and friends.
            I really do take physical and mental health seriously, as well as work-life balance! üòÅ
        </p>

        <p>
            On this site, I hope you can find something useful about building web applications with TypeScript, React.js and other software-related topics in <RouterLink to={pagesKey['coding']['path']}>{pagesKey['coding']['name']}</RouterLink>.
            Occasionally, I will attempt to share about other topics that interest me in my <RouterLink to={pagesKey['blog']['path']}>{pagesKey['blog']['name']}</RouterLink>,
            such as active and healthy lifestyle, travel, personal finance, climate change and conservation, or simply random things I learn from building the life I love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks for stopping by and I hope you have a beautiful day! üåª
        </p>

        Sincerely,<br />
