        <h2>Hi friend! ‚òÄÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
            I‚Äôm Thi, by profession, a full-stack software engineer who spends most of the year in the Northern Virginia/Washington, DC, USA.
            In July 2023, I decided to take a short break from my 9-5 job to work on projects that I've been wanting to do (like this website!).
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, I love creating software to solve problems and improve daily efficiency for myself and others. I'm also passionate about learning and sharing my knowledge.
            Recently, I discovered my love for building ReactJS, TypeScript applications, and I'm working a couple projects with these two technologies, as well as writing tutorials to share what I learn.
        </p>

        <p>
            At other times, I enjoy being active and spending time outdoors, reading, traveling, and exploring new places.
            Besides work, I think life offers so many meaningful and exciting experiences! Therefore, if this site appears to be outdated, please don‚Äôt think of me as a slacker (although I could be sometimes),
            as I might be somewhere enjoying a beautiful hike or bike ride, running, doing yoga, playing volleyball, reading a good book, practicing guitar, volunteering, or spending quality time with my family and friends.
            I really do take physical and mental health seriously, as well as work - life balance! üòÅ
        </p>

        <p>
            On this site, I hope you can find something useful about programming in my Coding page.
            And occasionally, I might attempt to write about other topics that interest me in my Blog,
            such as living frugally, travel and travel hacking, side hustling, climate change and conservation, and lessons I've learned in building the life I love.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thanks for stopping by and I hope you have a beautiful day! üåª
        </p>

        Sincerely,<br />
        Thi Nguyen
